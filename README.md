## 📖 Abstract

Most existing 3D referring expression segmentation (3DRES) methods rely on dense, high-quality point clouds, while real-world agents such as robots and mobile phones operate with only a few sparse RGB views and strict latency constraints. 

We introduce **Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES)**, where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. 

We propose the **Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT)**, an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning. Experiments show that MVGGT establishes the first strong baseline and achieves both high accuracy and fast inference, outperforming existing alternatives.

## 🚀 Method: MVGGT

We propose the **Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT)**, an end-to-end framework designed for efficiency and robustness.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sosppxo/mvggt.git
cd mvggt
```

### 2. Create conda environment

Create and activate a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n mvggt python=3.12
conda activate mvggt
```

### 3. Install dependencies
Install the full requirements for training:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Data Preparation

### 1. ScanNet dataset
Download the [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) dataset. The data should be organized as follows:

```text
[data_root]/
|   └──scene0000_00/
│       ├── color/              # RGB images (.jpg)
│       ├── depth/              # Depth maps (.png)
│       ├── intrinsic/          # intrinsic_depth.txt
│       └── pose/               # Camera poses (.txt)
└── scans/                  # Required for 2D instance masks
    └── scene0000_00/
        └── scene0000_00_2d-instance-filt/
            └── instance-filt/  # 2D instance segmentation masks (.png)
```
⚠️ Note: Remember to update the data_root path for both train_dataset and test_dataset in configs/data/example.yaml to point to your actual [data_root].

### 2. ScanRefer dataset
Download [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) annotations.

Put the `ScanRefer` folder in `data/`:
```text
data/
└── ScanRefer/
    ├── ScanRefer_filtered_train.json
    ├── ScanRefer_filtered_val.json
    ├── ScanRefer_filtered_train.txt
    └── ScanRefer_filtered_val.txt
```

### 3. Invalid Frame List
If you need to regenerate the invalid frame list based on your data, run:
```bash
python scripts/generate_invalid_scannet_list.py
```

### 4. Scene Frame Indices
To enable target-centric sampling and ensure the model sees the referred objects during training, we use pre-computed instance-to-frame mapping:
```text
data/
└── scene_frame_indices/
    └── [scene_id].json
```

### 5. MVrefer Benchmark (mvrefer_val.json)
This file contains frame selections for evaluation:
```text
data/
└── mvrefer_val.json
```
## 📦 Model Weights

For training and inference, you need to prepare the following weights in the `ckpts/` directory:

### 1. Pi3 Weights
The multimodal branch is initialized from [Pi3](https://huggingface.co/yyfz233/Pi3). Download and place it in:
```text
ckpts/
└── Pi3/
```

### 2. RoBERTa Weights
The model uses [RoBERTa-base](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-base/tree/main) as the text encoder. Download and place it in:
```text
ckpts/
└── roberta-base
```

### 3. Pre-trained MVGGT (For Inference)
Download the final MVGGT checkpoint from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sosppxo/mvggt) and update `train.resume` in `eval_mvggt.sh`.

## 🚀 Training

To start training on ScanRefer:
```bash
bash train_mvggt.sh
```

## 🔍 Inference

Update the checkpoint path (train.resume) in eval_mvggt.sh, then run inference:
```bash
bash eval_mvggt.sh
```

## 🚀 Demo Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the interactive demo locally:

### 1. Install demo dependencies

Install the required packages for the demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_demo.txt
```

### 2. Download model weights and tokenizer

1. **Download pre-trained model weights**: Download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sosppxo/mvggt) and update the `ckpt_path` in `demo_gradio.py` (line 608) to point to your checkpoint file.

2. **Download RoBERTa tokenizer**: The demo requires RoBERTa tokenizer. Download it using:

```bash
mkdir ckpts
python -c "from transformers import RobertaTokenizer; RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base').save_pretrained('./ckpts/roberta-base')"
```

Or manually download from Hugging Face and place it in `./ckpts/roberta-base/`.

### 3. Launch the demo

Run the Gradio demo:

```bash
python demo_gradio.py
```

The demo will be available at `http://localhost:7860`.

### Usage

1. Upload multiple images or a video containing multi-view scenes
2. Enter a referring expression describing the target object
3. The model will generate 3D segmentation results that can be downloaded as GLB files
